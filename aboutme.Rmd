# Sawasdee Ka!
### My name is Puri :)


#
I'm originally from Thailand but now live in Texas.

Before coming to the states, I was a Geophysicist for Chevron in Bangkok.

Since arriving in the states I've experience I continue to work in the O&G industry but as a Data Analyst for EOG Resources.

While working at EOG, my interest has shifted from geology to Data Science.  I'm now pursuing a Master Degree in Data Science at SMU!
